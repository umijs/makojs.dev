# Getting Started

## Install Mako

Install Mako via npm or pnpm.

```bash
$ npm i @umijs/mako -D
```

Then you can run Mako via npx.

```bash
$ npx mako -v
```

## Your first bundle

Create a new directory and add a simple `index.ts` file.

```bash
$ mkdir my-app && cd my-app
$ mkdir src
$ echo "console.log('Hello Mako!')" > src/index.ts
```

Then run Mako to build the bundle.

```bash
$ npx mako build
Building with mako for development...
dist/index.js       7.04 kB │ map: 8.87 kB
✓ Built in 20ms
Complete!
```

Finally, run the bundle to see the output.

```bash
$ node dist/index.js
Hello Mako!
```

## Bundle with React

Create a new Mako project with the following command.

```bash
$ npm create mako
```

Then cd into the project directory and run.

```bash
$ cd mako-project
$ npm run dev

Finally, if you want to build the project for production, run the following command.

```bash
$ npm run build
Building with mako for production...
dist/index.js       144.68 kB │ map: 354.22 kB
✓ Built in 96ms
Complete!
```

## Bundle with Umi

The latest Umi supports Mako out of the box. You can enable Mako in Umi project by setting the `mako` field in the config file.

First, make sure you have umi@4.2.0 or above installed.

```bash
$ npx umi -v
4.2.0
```

Then, add the `mako` field in your config file.

```bash
$ npx umi config set mako {}
```

Which will generate the following config in `.umirc.ts` or `config/config.ts`.

```diff
export default {
+   mako: {},
};
```

Now you can run the umi project with Mako.

```bash
$ umi build
